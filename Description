My API deals with book and author management. 
a full list of books from the feeder class can be obtained or a specific book can be obtained using the book id.
i was not able to fully implement all my get methods (like the getbyGenreId) and my update method is not working properly.
The delete method works, as well as the create method (though it only creates an empty instance but with the next ID).
